Step 1: Determine Daily Caloric Needs
Estimate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR): Use the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:

For men: BMR=10×weight (kg)+6.25×height (cm)−5×age (years)+5

For women: BMR=10×weight (kg)+6.25×height (cm)−5×age (years)−161
Calculate Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE):
Multiply BMR by an activity factor:

Sedentary: ×1.2
Lightly active: ×1.375
Moderately active: ×1.55
Very active: ×1.725

Create a Caloric Deficit:
Aim for a deficit of 500–750 calories/day for safe weight loss of 0.5–1 kg/week.

Step 2: Macronutrient Breakdown
Protein: 20–30% of daily calories
(~1.2–1.6 g/kg of body weight to preserve lean muscle mass)
Fats: 20–30% of daily calories
(Focus on healthy fats like nuts, seeds, olive oil, and avocados)
Carbohydrates: 40–50% of daily calories
(Prioritize whole grains, fruits, and vegetables)
Step 3: Food Choices
Focus on Whole, Nutrient-Dense Foods:

Lean proteins: Chicken, turkey, fish, tofu, beans, and eggs.
Whole grains: Brown rice, quinoa, oats, whole wheat bread.
Vegetables: Non-starchy veggies like spinach, broccoli, zucchini, and peppers.
Fruits: Berries, apples, oranges, and other low-sugar fruits.
Healthy fats: Olive oil, nuts, seeds, avocado.

Minimize:

Sugary drinks and snacks.
Refined carbs (white bread, pastries).
High-fat processed foods.
Step 4: Meal Plan Example
Breakfast:

2 boiled eggs
1 slice of whole-grain toast
1 small avocado
1 cup of green tea
Snack:

1 apple
1 handful of almonds (15–20 pieces)
Lunch:

Grilled chicken breast (150g)
Quinoa (1/2 cup)
Steamed broccoli and carrots (1 cup each)
Olive oil and lemon dressing
Snack:

Greek yogurt (low-fat, unsweetened) with a sprinkle of chia seeds
Dinner:

Grilled salmon (120g)
Mixed green salad with olive oil and balsamic vinegar
Sweet potato (1 medium, baked)
Optional Evening Snack:

1 cup of herbal tea
A handful of unsalted walnuts
Step 5: Additional Recommendations
Hydration: Drink at least 2–3 liters of water daily.
Physical Activity: Combine strength training and aerobic exercise 4–5 times per week.
Sleep: Ensure 7–9 hours of quality sleep each night to support metabolism and recovery.
Track Progress: Use a food diary or app to monitor intake and adjust as needed.


For Veg Only:

Food Choices:
Protein Sources:

Legumes (lentils, chickpeas, black beans).
Tofu, tempeh, seitan.
Low-fat dairy (Greek yogurt, paneer, milk).
Eggs (if lacto-ovo vegetarian).
Plant-based protein powders (pea, rice, soy).
Edamame, hemp seeds, chia seeds.
Whole Grains: Brown rice, quinoa, oats, whole-grain bread, and pasta.

Vegetables: Leafy greens, broccoli, zucchini, carrots, bell peppers.

Healthy Fats: Nuts, seeds (chia, flax, pumpkin), avocado, olive oil.

Fruits: Apples, berries, oranges, bananas (moderation for high-calorie fruits).


Tips for Vegetarians:

Track Protein: Aim for 1.2–1.6 g/kg of body weight daily from diverse plant-based sources.
B12 Supplementation: Consider a supplement if dietary intake is insufficient (common for vegetarians).
Hydration: Drink 2–3 liters of water daily.
Physical Activity: Combine resistance training (to preserve muscle mass) and cardio.
Meal Prep: Pre-cook legumes, grains, and vegetables for easy access.
