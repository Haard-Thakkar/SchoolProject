Nutritional Goals
Increase Caloric Density:
Add calorie-dense ingredients like nuts, seeds, avocados, and oils to meals.

Eat Frequently:
Aim for 5–6 smaller meals/snacks throughout the day if larger meals feel overwhelming.

Focus on Protein:
Support muscle gain and repair with lean proteins (or plant-based options for vegetarians).

Hydrate Wisely:
Avoid filling up on low-calorie drinks like water before meals. Opt for smoothies or milk with meals instead.

Additional Tips
Incorporate Liquid Calories:
Smoothies, milkshakes, and soups can add calories without making you feel too full.

Exercise:
Focus on strength training (2–3 times/week) to encourage muscle gain rather than fat accumulation. Avoid excessive cardio.

Track Progress:
Weigh yourself weekly and adjust calorie intake if weight gain stalls.

Nutrient Supplementation:

Consider a multivitamin to fill any gaps in nutrition.
Ensure adequate intake of calcium, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids (especially for vegetarians).
